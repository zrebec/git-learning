## General principles

### Color & Contrast

Text should be readable

### Whitespace

Check space between elements

### Scale

Relative element sizing

### Visual Hierarchy

Arrange in order of importance

### Typography

Typeface, sizing, etc...

## JavaScript

### JS Basics

Data types, data structures, functions, loops

### DOM

Document object model

### Async JS

Promises, Async/Await

### Fetch API & HTTP

Make requests to API & understanding HTTP

### Array methods

map, filter, reduce, etc...

## Additional SW for FE

### GIT

Popular version control system

### NPM

Node package manager for install packages into project. Needs NodeJS

### Browser web tools

Important for all types of developers. Element selector, console, storage, network activity, etc... (Order the tabs in your browser by this)

### VS Code extensions

Emmet, Live Server, Prettier, ESLint, GitHub Copilot, etc...

## Git

Teach Markdown as one of the first things.

'git init' Initalize local repository (this must be a first step)  
'git add .' Add all files into staged area  
'git commit -m "Fist initialize" -m "Created index.html and make first commit in this file"' commit changes into local repository with comment _First initalize_ and _Created index.html and make first commit in this file_ as description.  
'git push origin master' upload changes into remote master branch  
'git pull origin master' Download (fetch) all remote changes from master branch
'git branch' list all branches  
'git checkout -b developer' Create a branch called _developer_ and switch into it

### Remote repositories

GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket
